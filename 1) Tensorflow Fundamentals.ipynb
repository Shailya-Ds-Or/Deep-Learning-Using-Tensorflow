    "## What is TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source end-to-end machine learning library for preprocessing data, modelling data and serving models (getting them into the hands of others).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than building machine learning and deep learning models from scratch, it's more likely you'll use a library such as TensorFlow. This is because it contains many of the most common machine learning functions you'll want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is vast. But the main premise is simple: turn data into numbers (tensors) and build machine learning algorithms to find patterns in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we cover some of the most fundamental TensorFlow operations, more specificially:\n",
    "* Introduction to tensors (creating tensors)\n",
    "* Getting information from tensors (tensor attributes)\n",
    "* Manipulating tensors (tensor operations)\n",
    "* Tensors and NumPy\n",
    "* Using @tf.function (a way to speed up your regular Python functions)\n",
    "* Using GPUs with TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "* Many of the conventions here will happen automatically behind the scenes (when you build a model) but it's worth knowing so if you see any of these things, you know what's happening.\n",
    "* For any TensorFlow function you see, it's important to be able to check it out in the documentation, for example, going to the Python API docs for all functions and searching for what you need: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/ \n"

    "\n",
    "If you aren't sure what Python decorators do, [read RealPython's guide on them](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/).\n",

    "In the `@tf.function` decorator case, it turns a Python function into a callable TensorFlow graph. Which is a fancy way of saying, if you've written your own Python function, and you decorate it with `@tf.function`, when you export your code (to potentially run on another device), TensorFlow will attempt to convert it into a fast(er) version of itself (by making it part of a computation graph).\n",
